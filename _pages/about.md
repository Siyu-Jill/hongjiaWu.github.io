# Hongjia Wu (Âê¥Ëôπ‰Ω≥)

Hi, I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, the Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK). 
I received Ph.D. degree at the College of Computer Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China, supervised by Prof. [Zhiping Cai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&mauthors=Zhiping+Cai&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). During my doctoral studies (2019‚Äì2023), I expanded my research horizons as a China Scholarship Council (CSC) Visiting student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), guided by Prof. [Zehui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&mauthors=zehui+xiong&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I also served as a visiting scholar in Information and Communication Engineering at the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ), where I studied with Prof. [Lin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=41wcJi4AAAAJ&hl=en) to advance research on Large AI models, Mobile Edge Computing and Game Theory. 
Now, I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at EdUHK working with Assistant Professor [Tse-Tin Chan](https://www.eduhk.hk/mit/en/staff/tsetinchan) in the **HK-SZ-Wireless Group**. 

My research interests are **in the interdisciplinary area between game theory, network optimization, and artificial intelligence**.

Feel free to contact me for communication and collaboration: <u>whongjia@eduhk.hk</u>
