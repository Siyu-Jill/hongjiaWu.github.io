# **Hi, I am Hongjia Wu (Âê¥Ëôπ‰Ω≥)**

I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, the Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK).  
My academic journey began with a Master's degree in Software Engineering from Guangxi University. I then completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), supervised by Prof. [Zhiping Cai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&mauthors=Zhiping+Cai&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). During my doctoral studies (2019‚Äì2023), I expanded my research horizons as a China Scholarship Council (CSC) Visiting student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), guided by Prof. [Zehui Xiong (https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&mauthors=zehui+xiong&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).  I also served as a Visiting Scholar in Information and Communication Engineering at the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ), where I studied with Prof. [Lin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=41wcJi4AAAAJ&hl=en) to advance research on **AI-generated content in edge computing**. 
Now, I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at EdUHK working with Assistant Professor [Tse-Tin Chan](https://www.eduhk.hk/mit/en/staff/tsetinchan) in the **HK-SZ-Wireless Group**. 

My research interests include Network for Large AI models, Mobile Edge Computing and Game Theory.

Feel free to contact me for communication and collaboration: <u>whongjia@eduhk.hk</u>
