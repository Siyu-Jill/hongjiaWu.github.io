# Hongjia Wu (吴虹佳)
Hi, I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, Education University of Hong Kong.
I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree from Liaoning Technical University and Guangxi University in 2016 and 2018, respectively.
I received the Ph.D. degree from the National University of Defense Technology, China, in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiping Cai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&mauthors=Zhiping+Cai&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I was a CSC visiting scholar at the Singapore University of
Technology and Design, under the supervision of Prof. [Zehui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=search_authors&mauthors=zehui+xiong&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)，在2021-2023年期间.  曾经在 Information and Communication Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen,是访问学者， under the supervision of Prof. [Lin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=41wcJi4AAAAJ&hl=en).
 Now, I am a Post-doctoral Fellow at the Education University of Hong Kong in China. 

 
interests include computational offloading, game theory, resource allocation, and dispersed computing.


My research interests include Network for Large AI models and AI for networking, Mobile Edge Computing and Game Theory.
